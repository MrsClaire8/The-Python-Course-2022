Repo contains three simple apps, based on the Udemy course "The Python Mega Course 2022 by Ardit Sulce" There are short descriptions of each of them below:

1. Texteditor.py
2. Konwerter.py
3. Map.py

Ad. 1
I made this simple app to practice python's while loop. The app edits the plain text typed by the user. It changes the first letter to a capital letter, joins sentences, and adds commas at the end. The function is executed by the "exit" command.

Ad. 2
The app converts kilograms to grams, pounds, and ounces. It has GUI made in the Tkinter.

Ad. 3
Interactive map of volcanoes located in the USA. In this app, I used Folium and Pandas libraries.
